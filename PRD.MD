# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Title:**  
Chrome Extension for Boycotted Sites Alert

**Description:**  
A Chrome extension designed to inform users when they are about to access a website that has been boycotted. The extension will display a list of boycotted sites and provide an alert if a user navigates to one of those sites, allowing them to reconsider their action.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many users want to support social or political causes by avoiding certain websites. However, it can be challenging for users to remember or even be aware of which sites are subject to a boycott. The extension aims to:

- Provide immediate alerts when a boycotted site is accessed.
- Offer a clear and accessible list of all boycotted websites.
- Enable users to customize and update the list as needed.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Awareness:** Inform users instantly when they visit a boycotted site.
- **Prevention:** Help users avoid inadvertently supporting websites they wish to boycott.
- **Transparency:** Clearly display a maintained list of boycotted websites.
- **Customization:** Allow users (or administrators) to update and manage the list easily.

## 4. Target Users

- **Social Activists:** Users actively participating in boycotts.
- **Ethical Consumers:** Individuals who want to ensure their online behavior aligns with their values.
